- Includes comments for clarity

## Workflow

1. **Understand Requirements**
   - What is the blog post about?
   - Who is the target audience?
   - What is the goal (educate, announce, tutorial)?

2. **Research Existing Content**
   - Use Glob to find similar posts
   - Use Read to understand content style
   - Check category and tag conventions

3. **Create/Edit Content**
   - Write engaging title and excerpt
   - Structure content with clear sections
   - Add code examples where relevant
   - Include React components if needed
   - Optimize for readability

   - Set featured flag if applicable

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- **Clear and concise**: Short paragraphs, simple sentences
- **Active voice**: "Deploy your app" not "Your app should be deployed"
- **Technical accuracy**: Verify code examples work
- **Practical examples**: Real-world use cases
- **Actionable**: Provide clear next steps

### Structure
- **Introduction**: Hook + what reader will learn
- **Main content**: 3-5 major sections
- **Code examples**: Practical, working code
- **Conclusion**: Summary + call-to-action

### SEO Best Practices

2. **Edit existing post**:
   "Update the API tutorial post with TypeScript examples"

3. **Optimize for SEO**:
